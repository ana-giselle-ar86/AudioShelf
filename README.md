AudioShelf is a specialized desktop application designed for audiobook enthusiasts who need precision, organization, and accessibility. Unlike generic media players, AudioShelf understands that every book is a unique journey with its own progress, history, and settings.

---

## 🌟 Why AudioShelf?

Most players treat audio files equally. AudioShelf treats every book as a distinct entity.

### 📚 Book-Centric Management
*   **Independent Progress:** Remembers exactly where you left off in *every single book*, down to the second.
*   **Smart Metadata:** Automatically imports and manages book details, chapters, and file structures.
*   **Metadata Persistence:** Saves your progress, bookmarks, and playback state directly alongside the book files (`.json`). Move your library to another PC, and your listening history moves with it.
*   **Dedicated History:** Keep track of your recently played books in a dedicated history tab.

### 🎛️ Professional Playback Control
*   **Smart Resume:** Intelligently rewinds a few seconds after long pauses so you never lose the context of the story.
*   **A-B Loop:** Repeat specific sections of audio effortlessly—perfect for language learners.
*   **Variable Speed:** Adjust playback speed without distorting the narrator's voice (Pitch-corrected).
*   **10-Band Equalizer:** Custom audio presets (e.g., Vocal Clarity) to enhance different narrators' voices.

### 🗣️ Accessibility First
* **Screen Reader Optimized:** Built from the ground up with native support for screen readers (including **NVDA** and **JAWS**) for precise semantic announcements.
*   **Keyboard-Driven:** Every single feature is accessible via customizable hotkeys for a mouse-free experience.

### 🛠️ Powerful Tools
*   **Auto-Updater:** Automatically checks for and installs the latest updates at startup.
*   **Sleep Timer:** Configurable timer with system actions (Shutdown/Sleep/Hibernate).
*   **Portable Mode:** Run AudioShelf directly from a USB drive without installation.
